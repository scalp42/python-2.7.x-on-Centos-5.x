# Python 2.7.x on CentOS 5.x


## Description

Upgrade python (http://www.python.org/) to latest stable version without breaking yum on CentOS 5.x.

It also installs by **default** [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/), [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) and [fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/), **but can be skipped**.

This script was tested on:

* CentOS 5.5 (i686)
* CentOS 5.6 (i686)
* CentOS 5.7 (x86_64)

It's [idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Computer_science_meaning) and cleanup after itself on exit or interrupt (^X^C).



## Requirements

This script has **only** been tested on CentOS 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8. 

**Please do NOT run it on CentOS 6.x (it should not be needed)**.

## Usage

You must be root or use sudo.

	#> ./install_python27.sh
	
You can edit `dest` in `install_python27.sh` to select destination path for python:

	dest="/usr/local"
	
If you **do not** wish to install python extras (pip, virtualenv and fabric), please set:
	
	install_extras="false"


## Todo
* allow Python 3 to be installed.



## Need Help or Want to Contribute ?

All contributions are welcome: ideas, patches, documentation, bug reports, complaints, and even something you drew up on a napkin.

It is more important to me that you are able to contribute and get help if you need it.

That said, some basic guidelines, which you are free to ignore :)

- Have a problem you want this script to solve for you ? You can email me personally (scalisi.a@gmail.com)
- Have an idea or a feature request? File a ticket on Github, or email me personally (scalisi.a@gmail.com) if this is more comfortable.
- If you think you found a bug, it probably is a bug. Please file a ticket on Github.
- If you want to make it better, best way is to fork this repo and send me a pull request. If you don't know git, I also accept diff(1) formatted patches - whatever is most comfortable for you.

**Programming is not a required skill**. Whatever you've seen about open source with maintainers or community members saying "send patches or die" -  you will not see that here.
